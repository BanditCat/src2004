<h3>Handler</h3>
<pre>
class Handler{
public:
  virtual void mousehandler( const MouseEvent& ) = 0;
  virtual void keyhandler( const KeyEvent& ) = 0;
  virtual void tick( fpnum tcks ) = 0;
};
</pre>
<p>Handler is an abstract class that represents the functions necessary for running a program.
It has three virtual methods: tick, mousehandler and keyhandler.  mousehandler and keyhandler get called during an Engine::tick if there is pending input. The handler tick gets called every time Engine::tick is called. Every time the handler tick gets called its parameter will be set to the approximate number of milliseconds since the last call to Engine::tick.</p>

<h3>MouseEvent</h3>
<pre>
struct MouseEvent{
  static const byte leftbutton = 1;
  static const byte rightbutton = 2;
  static const byte middlebutton = 3;
  enum Type { pressed, released, doubleclicked } type; 
  byte button;
};
</pre>
<p>A MouseEvent has two fields, type, which is an enumerant that tells whether it was a press, a release or a double click and button, which indicates the button that generated the event.  MouseEvent defines three constants: leftbutton, rightbutton and middlebutton, these are the possible values of button when a event is sent.</p>

<a name="keyevent"></a>
<h3>KeyEvent</h3>
<pre>
struct KeyEvent{
  bool pressed;
  byte symbol;
};
</pre>
<p>A KeyEvent has two fields. The first, pressed, is true if the event is a key press and false if it is a key release. The second, symbol, is the symbol for the key that got pressed.  The symbol is a VK type symbol, such as VK_ESCAPE.</p>
