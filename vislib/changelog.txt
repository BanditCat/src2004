. Made this file.

. Inverted y axis in bump vector unpacking for the main fragment shader, now bumpmaps are DirectX friendly.
Also changed RGBSurface::makebumpmap to agree with new mapping.

. Made it so the vertex shader generates texture space R vectors via cross product rather than reading them
in from a VBO.  Also changed Drawables to reflect this.

. Changed mouse handling so that a double click sets the button pressed flag for that button instead
of just generating a double-click event.



12/16/04
. Created Texture class and seperated OpenGL texture functionality from the Surface class. 

. UnGPLed the software to make it more friendly.

. Wrote Drawable::testneighbors so that I can make neighbour detection faster than findneighbors ( later ).

. Made Engine::init take a parameter indicating whether or not to start with anisotropy. ( document ).



12/17/04
. Started a features list at the beginning of this file.

. Created vis/cgshader.H and cgshader.cpp to house shader functionality.

. Started work on CGShader class.



12/18/04
. Finished work on CGShader class.

. Added support for wireframes to Display and changed gears to reflect this ( use w key to turn on wireframes ).



12/19/04
. Started work on proper shadow volumes and got caught zfighting.



12/20/04
. Finished work on proper shadow volumes and fixed zfighting by biasing the vertex shader.



12/23/04
. Updated documentation and did some minor fixes/spellchecking.



12/24/04
. Updated docs so that structures are actually defined.
. Cleaned up Display::update by splitting off functionality into new functions ( Display::drawnormal and Display::drawshadow ).
. Documented headers: display.H engine.H lighting.H
. Undocumented headers: assess.H draw.H geometry.H surface.H stack.H algo.H cgshader.H
